## Basic of Database

-Transient
  - Program data is transient
  - When the program ends, data is lost
  - If we return the program , the data will need to regenerated
- Persistent data
  - organized collections of data (that reside on a computer)
  - digital organization methods: Relational/NoSQL databases

#### Relational databases
- Data is stored in 2-dimensional tables
- Tables (relations) are logically connected sets of data
- Tables rows (records/tuples) are information about one entity
- Table columns are attribute values
- Uses SQL for information retrieval
- Goal: Minimize redundancy and maximize consistency

- Data Model
  - the abstract structure of the database. entities and their relationships
  - Entities, Relationships, Attributes
- Relational model
  - the database represented as a set of tables (relations)
- Normalization
  - the process of reorganizing a relational database to decrease data redundancy and increase data consistency


#### NoSQL databases
- Low latency
- Scalability
- Redundancy
- Typically stored on the cloud
- Does not (necessarily) use SQL (hence NoSQL)
- Examples: MongoDB, Google BigTable, Sparksee, Amazon DynamoDB
- JSON format



- TEMP
-  this data is redundant
