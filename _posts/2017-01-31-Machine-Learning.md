## Machine Learning

- It deals with developing automatic algorithms
  - for identifying patterns in complex data and
  - for making prediction based on previous observations.
  - An algorithm takes some inputs and produces some outputs.
- Applications include
  - search engines
  - image recognition: Take in some images, and output text descriptions of what the image contains.
  - speech recognition
  - natural language processing: Process an entire novel and output its themes or topics.
  - Machine Learning algorithms typically fit in either the supervised or unsupervised paradigm.
    - The process of training our algorithm earlier was called supervised learning. In supervised learning, we label some training data, some inputs, with expected outputs.

- Training data. For example, we can provide many examples of images of horses to an algorithm, to increase its ability to recognize new images of horses, by comparing them.

- Algorithm:
  - Nearest Neighbors Classfier
  - Image Classification with Python
  - Test the performance of the algorithm.
    - Not access to the entire database, rather than split the original data set into multiple subsets.

- Much like the way humans learn, also machine learning algorithm gets better with the amount of training sets they have access to.

- Dimensional
  - Lineland
  - Flatland
  - Spaceland:Three-dimensional
  - N dimensional space
  - In our case, we live in a three-dimensional space, but we can similarly map points to spaces with even more dimensions. Convert everything into some points in space.

- Distance
  - There was a notion of point and distance in a higher-dimensional space.
  - Once we figured that out and we code it up in Python. The same distance function that works with two-dimensional points equally works with 64-dimensional points and higher.
  - Python doesn’t care about the dimension. It computes the distance, finds the minimum distance and the label for that point.

- 97% of correct - five lines of code. It’s rather surprising, isn’t it?
