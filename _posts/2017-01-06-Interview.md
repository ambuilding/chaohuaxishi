##### Stand Out in an Interview: 4 Strategies
- Prepare to sell yourself
  - uniqueness
  - hard and soft skills
  - Example:

    I started as a copywriter for a few years, so I've gained solid experience understanding the industry, and then I worked myself up in the same company and you can see that I just kept progressing, then I move up as a marketing officer, PR officer;
    so I worked at my first company for six years, and I just felt that it's about time that I need to expand my horizon, and my most recent company, I worked there for two years as an Assistant Marketing Manager.

    - What motivates you to do well?
    Well, I would say opportunity to learn new things.
    You see in my previous job, I had a great chance to manage a team;
    it was a small team; but I've seen the impact, and I would say that the success of your team is such a huge motivation for further learning and development, and for excellence as well, and I've learned so much from this, so I would say learning new things and seeing people around you succeed.
    That's the best motivation

    - What is your weakness?
    My weakness. I would say [being] over-committed basically, I love
    to learn and I'm eager to help, so, sometimes I've just over-committed
    myself, to projects and to others;
    but I've learned my lesson, I know my limits, so what I will do coming forward, I'll prioritise and just choose the best project that I can really excel [at].



- Demonstrate your knowledge of the company
  - use LinkedIn and company webpage to know:
    - its strengths amongst competitors
    - the reason for job opening
      - Is it a replacement?
      - Is it an addition?
    - what's their market place reputation?
      - what products do they have
      - what presence do they have in Asia? Or globally?
    - the interviewers(who, why you are talking to them)
      - are you interviewing with HR, a line manager or somebody who is directly going to hire you?

    - Example:

    Why do you want to work for this company?
    Well you see, yours is a very reputable company, and I have done some research as well, and from what I've seen, from the projects that you were running and that you are running, from the documents in the
    report, it seems that the culture and the values, the core values of the company really align with mine, and I would like to learn more from you, and I would like to continue developing further with you as well, and I'm confident this is going to be a mutually beneficial relationship.


- Adjust your mentality
  - 5 P's: Proper, Preparation, Prevents, Poor, Performence
    - Proper Preparation = Rehearse aloud
  - Rationalise the situation
    - Nervous interviewees make nervous interviewers
- Sharpen your appearance
  - Dress for the job
    - professionally
    - appropriately
    - younger candidates: be mindful of appearing too "relaxed and casual"

##### Answering the interviewer's questions

- What motivates you to do well?
- How would you manage yourself?
- What have you most impoved in the last twelve months?

- What do you consider to be your most significant accomplishment so far?
- "Tell me about an experience", or in this case "Tell me about an accomplishment in your career".

    Using the STAR technique. This will help you better organise your ideas. STAR stands for the four steps in answering a question - Situation, Task, Activity and Result.

    First, present the SITUATION - set the context for your story. Tell the interviewer the background of the event that you will talk about.

    Next, talk about the TASK - what was required of you. List your responsibilities during that experience. For example, "It was my responsibility to liaise with business executives for new
    business opportunities".

    Then, state the ACTIVITY. What you actually did. Discuss the specific activities or tasks that you performed.

    Lastly, talk about the RESULT. How well the situation played out. Tell the interviewers what was the concrete result or impact of what you did.

- Don't forget to use action verbs!
