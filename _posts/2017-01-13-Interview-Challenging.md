- show your interest
- show your personality
- assess company's suitability for you

- What is my background
- What is my likes
- What is my dislikes
- Why am I here
- Why do I want to this job

### Plan and ask for:
- guidance on how you can contribute
- information about the company's operation
- confirmation of your suitability
  - Do I have the skill sets that you're looking for?
  - I'd really love to work here.
  - I think I can add a lot of value to your organisation because you're looking for ABC, and I've done 1, 2, 3.

- What kind of training opportunities do you offer?
- What is the expectation you would put on me within the first six months of my employment here?

- I'm interested in knowing more about your company's plans.
  - Could you tell me a little more about your company's directions?

### What you should do after an interview?
### What should you do once an interview is over?
- Follow-up actions
  - wait patiently
  - send thank-you email
  - send letter of appreciation
  - write a postcard

### Question and answer
#### What are your long term career goals?
#### Where do you see yourself in five years?(similar)

    Well you see, I understand there is a lot I need to learn
    in the field
    and I would like to continue building my skills in terms of day to day management.
    And I'd like to learn more about personnel management.
    Because I believe that this will help prepare me for a higher level position in the future,
    because I believe it's really important to stay challenged in our role
    and in terms of short term goals,
    I would like to really grow with your company, learning about it more, become a team member, and develop further professionally.

    In terms of long term career goals, that would be great
    if I would have a chance to run a couple of projects,
    and manage a team of maybe junior colleagues, so that
    I could show my leadership skills, and continue growing professionally.


    My long term career goal is to be responsible for the design jobs of major corporate events at your company,
    and to be able to collaborate with internationally renowned brands in the
    field.
    I'm willing to invest five years learning all aspects of the job towards professional advancement.
    In five years, I see myself as a senior product designer at your company doing work at increasing levels of responsibility and skill.
    I'd love to be the designing team leader mentoring junior designers and managing more people.
    I find this position appealing because I think it will move me in that direction.

    You should always have goals: recruiters are always looking for
    people with ambitions, not people who have no idea where they`re going.
