    Because I'm a good fit for this position.

    With my years of working experience as an Accounts Assistant, I'm familiar with the job and am ready to take charge any time.

    As a Singaporean who has been living and working in Hong Kong for 3 years, I'm probably the ideal person to do that.

    I also have a good command of written and spoken English and Chinese, and have been able to develop solid communication and interpersonal
    skills through my customer service experience in Singapore.
    I'm also able to work under pressure and within time limits.

    So I'm confident I would be a valuable addition to your team.

    I understand their needs and their wants.

  - Highlight your skills and how you might be different from someone else competing for the same job.
  - Don't forget to use action verbs from your CV.

- Show sincerity when answering.
  - Be confident, but also be truthful about what you can do,
  - what you want to do and where you plan to go with the company.

### Expressing opinion and delaying answers

#### Why do you want to leave your job?

    Well, you see I started as a fresh graduate, like with no experience whatsoever in the field, and having worked in the company for a couple of years, I feel like I have a better understanding of the industry and nature of my job as well.

    And I'd really like to move further, and I'd like to develop further my skills. Unfortunately it seems that in the company where I'm working at the moment, there mightn't be enough opportunities for further career growth and this is what I am looking for at the moment. So, that's the main reason.

    I've been with my company for a while so I think it's time for me to seek exposure in the field.
    I love learning new challenges take up new challenges, learning new things, and work with a diverse team,
    I just want to expand my horizon,I think it's about time for me to, seek new opportunities, Yes, basically it's just mainly curiosity has brought me here today.

- Expressing personal and professional growth
  - develop further
  - have further career growth
  - seek exposure
  - take up new challenges
  - work with a diverse team

#### What is your weakness?
- Strategy: overcoming weaknesses
- Clearly state one quality
- Briefly describe possible problem
- Specifically outline action taken


#### What would you do if you disagreed with a superior?
#### Describing a time when you didn't get along with a co-worker

    Once I worked in a project with my manager, and a few colleagues
    and my manager suggested that I should devise a new marketing plan
    which actually contradicts with the client's original idea
    so it took me a while to negotiate with my manager
    and also my clients, and at last I made it,
    and they both just like the marketing plans.

#### How to delay an answer.
  - That's a good question. Can I think about it for a moment please?
  - I;m not absolutely sure, but I'm sure I could figure it out.

### Question and answer
#### What are your long term career goals?
#### Where do you see yourself in five years?(similar)

    Well you see, I understand there is a lot I need to learn
    in the field
    and I would like to continue building my skills in terms of day to day management.
    And I'd like to learn more about personnel management.
    Because I believe that this will help prepare me for a higher level position in the future,
    because I believe it's really important to stay challenged in our role
    and in terms of short term goals,
    I would like to really grow with your company, learning about it more, become a team member, and develop further professionally.

    In terms of long term career goals, that would be great
    if I would have a chance to run a couple of projects,
    and manage a team of maybe junior colleagues, so that
    I could show my leadership skills, and continue growing professionally.


    My long term career goal is to be responsible for the design jobs of major corporate events at your company,
    and to be able to collaborate with internationally renowned brands in the
    field.
    I'm willing to invest five years learning all aspects of the job towards professional advancement.
    In five years, I see myself as a senior product designer at your company doing work at increasing levels of responsibility and skill.
    I'd love to be the designing team leader mentoring junior designers and managing more people.
    I find this position appealing because I think it will move me in that direction.

    You should always have goals: recruiters are always looking for
    people with ambitions, not people who have no idea where they`re going.
