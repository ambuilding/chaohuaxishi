## Containers

- Docker-new development environment: No installation / Dockerfile / Build

- Define a container with a Dockerfile. Dockerfile will define what goes on in the environment inside your container.

### Setup `$ docker run hello-world`


### Get Started

- `$ docker build -t name .` `$ docker images` `$ docker run -p 4000:80 name`
- `$ docker run -p 4000:80 name` `http://localhost:4000 / $ curl http://localhost:4000`
- `docker run -p 80:80 username/repo:tag` `http://localhost/`

- Run the app in the background, in detached mode: `docker run -d -p 4000:80 friendlyhello` See abbreviated container ID: `docker container ls` End th eprocess: `docker container stop <Container ID>`

### Tag / Publish the image
- `docker tag image username/repository:tag` `$ docker images`
- `docker push username/repository:tag`
- From now on, you can use docker run and run your app on any machine with this command: `docker run -p 4000:80 username/repository:tag `

### Git database

- Git tree `~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data` `com.docker.driver.amd64-linux`

- `$ docker info` `$ docker info | grep Proxy`

- Fuck

	# Set proxy server, replace host:port with values for your servers
	`ENV http_proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080`
	`ENV https_proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080`


## Docker-Services

- In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services.” Services are really just “containers in production.”

- Scaling a service changes the number of container instances running that piece of software, assigning more computing resources to the service in the process.

- Define, run, and scale services with the Docker platform – just write a `docker-compose.yml`

- Run the new load-balanced app: `docker swarm init`

	Swarm initialized: current node (su2np68tvril4xcjp20odfbyt) is now a manager.

	To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3tp2gkfp3a4yxp93tf0ozz62isazfbvoldtsusdo06dk725wgq-4eleytibu50vbcnlx8v61b9nq 192.168.65.2:2377

	To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.

- `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml appname` `docker service ls` List the tasks for the service: `docker service ps getstartedlab_web` `docker container ls -q`

- Run `curl -4 http://localhost` or visit that URL in the browser. Either way, the  container ID wil change, demonstrating the load-balancing; with each request, one of the 5 tasks is chosen, in a round-robin fashion, to respond. The container IDs will match your output from the previous command (docker container ls -q).

### Take down the app and the swarm

- Take the app down with `docker stack rm <appName>`
- Take down the swarm `docker swarm leave --force`


## Swarms
- A swarm is a group of machines that are running Docker and joined into a cluster. Join multiple machines into a “Dockerized” cluster called a swarm.

- Deploy this app onto a cluster, running it on multiple machines.

## Set up the swarm
 - Create a cluster / two VMs

    ```
	$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox myvm1
	Running pre-create checks...
	(myvm1) No default Boot2Docker ISO found locally, downloading the latest release...
	(myvm1) Latest release for github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker is v17.10.0-ce
	(myvm1) Downloading /Users/william/.docker/machine/cache/boot2docker.iso from https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker/releases/download/v17.10.0-ce/boot2docker.iso...
	(myvm1) 0%....10%....20%....30%....40%....50%....60%....70%....80%....90%....100%

	Docker is up and running!
	To see how to connect your Docker Client to the Docker Engine running on this virtual machine, run: docker-machine env myvm1
	```
 - List the VMS and get their IP: `docker-machine ls`
 - Initialize the swarm and add nodes:

    ```
    $ docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.99.100"
	Swarm initialized: current node (m5ddcbmwk63e2ao182szg8vfq) is now a manager.

	To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4qgigh1juhts0mqfn2kgpxxm1cmt4a5ymow4zah4vrhhlb4tot-82oa8jfmzf6v130ow1dsief73 192.168.99.100:2377

	To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
    ```

    ```
    $ docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4qgigh1juhts0mqfn2kgpxxm1cmt4a5ymow4zah4vrhhlb4tot-82oa8jfmzf6v130ow1dsief73 192.168.99.100:2377"
    This node joined a swarm as a worker.
    ```
- View the nodes in the first swarm `docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker node ls"`

## Deploy the app on the swarm cluster

- Configure a `docker-machine` shell to the swarm manager. Run `docker-machine env myvm1` to get the command to configure the shell to talk to myvm1.

    ```
    $ docker-machine env myvm1
	export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY="1"
	export DOCKER_HOST="tcp://192.168.99.100:2376"
	export DOCKER_CERT_PATH="/Users/william/.docker/machine/machines/myvm1"
	export DOCKER_MACHINE_NAME="myvm1"
	# Run this command to configure your shell:
	# eval $(docker-machine env myvm1)
    ```

## Deploy the app on the swarm manager:
- `docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml getstartedlab`
- `$ docker stack ps getstartedlab`

## Accessing the cluster:
-The network we created is shared between them and load-balancing. We can access the app from the IP address of either myvm1 or myvm2.

## Cleanup and reboot

- Tear down the stack `docker stack rm getstartedlab`
- Remove swarm `docker-machine ssh myvm2 "docker swarm leave"` on the worker and `docker-machine ssh myvm1 "docker swarm leave --force"` on the manager.
- Unsetting docker-machine shell variable settings `eval $(docker-machine env -u)`


## Stacks
- A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies, and can be orchestrated and scaled together.

- Add a free visualizer service that lets us look at how the swarm is scheduling containers.

- Persist the data, add a Redis database for storing app data.
  - Add a Redis service.
  - Store data. Create a `./data` directory on the manager: `docker-machine ssh myvm1 "mkdir ./data"`
- Deploy and verify that the three services are running as expected.
